Overview
========

This project manages ESPHome sensors and devices for my Home Assistant deployment. It has a comprehensive Python security framework, automated deployment processes, and supports multiple hardware platforms including ESP32, ESP8266, and ESP01 devices. There is a two-stage build process for memory-constrained devices, and recent focus has been on ESP32-C6 platform migration for heat pump controllers and Bluetooth proxy integration.
