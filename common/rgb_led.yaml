# File: common/rgb_led.yaml
# Configuration for a single RGB LED connected to GPIO pins using the hardware PWM channels on an ESP8266.
# This file is included in various ESPHome configurations to standardize RGB LED setup.
# It sets up a GPIO output for each color channel (red, green, blue) and defines a light component to control the RGB LED.
