# Security Framework Migration Notes

This document contains historical information about migrations and changes to the security framework.

## Python Security Framework Migration

### Overview

The ESPHome security framework was migrated from mixed bash/Python scripts to a unified Python-based solution
for better maintainability, testing, and integration.

### Migration Summary

- **From**: Mixed bash and Python scripts
- **To**: Unified Python security framework with shared library
- **Benefits**: Better error handling, comprehensive testing, unified credential validation
- **Status**: Complete and active

### Script Replacements

| Old Bash Script | New Python Script | Status |
|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| `validate-secrets.sh` | [`validate_secrets.py`](../../scripts/validate_secrets.py) | ✅ Direct replacement |
| `validate-1password-structure.sh` | [`validate_1password_structure.py`](../../scripts/validate_1password_structure.py) | ✅ Direct replacement |
| `setup-security.sh` | [`setup_security.py`](../../scripts/setup_security.py) | ✅ Enhanced replacement |
| `rotate_credentials.py` | [`rotate_credentials.py`](../../scripts/rotate_credentials.py) | ✅ Refactored with shared library |

### New Functionality Added

- **[`track_secret_rotation.py`](../../scripts/track_secret_rotation.py)** - Rotation history tracking
- **[`setup_dev_secrets.py`](../../scripts/setup_dev_secrets.py)** - Development environment setup
- **[`backup_secrets.py`](../../scripts/backup_secrets.py)** - Backup and restore functionality

### Task Command Changes

| Old Command | New Command | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `task security-validate` | `task security-validate` | ✅ Same command, uses Python internally |
| `task security-scan` | `task security-scan` | ✅ Enhanced with Python validation |
| `./scripts/setup-security.sh` | `task security-setup` | ✅ Now uses Python script |
| `./scripts/validate-secrets.sh` | `python3 scripts/validate_secrets.py` | ✅ Direct Python execution |

### Migration Benefits

- **Unified Error Handling**: Consistent error messages and logging across all security operations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full unit test coverage with mock support for external dependencies
- **Better Integration**: Improved integration with ESPHome's Python ecosystem
- **Enhanced Functionality**: New features like rotation tracking and development environment support

### Backward Compatibility

The Python scripts maintain the same command-line interface and exit codes as the original bash scripts,
ensuring seamless integration with existing workflows.

## Pre-commit Hook Environment Fix

### Problem

Pre-commit hooks were failing to access dependencies managed by Mise because they run in isolated environments
without automatic Mise configuration sourcing.

### Solution

Created `.githooks/mise-python-wrapper.sh` to properly source the Mise environment for pre-commit hooks.

### Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Mise Python Wrapper for Pre-commit Hooks
set -e
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"

if command -v mise >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    exec mise exec -- python3 "$@"
else
    exec python3 "$@"
fi
```

### Configuration Changes
Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to use the wrapper script with `language: script` instead of `language: system`:

**Before:**
```yaml
- id: esphome-secrets-validation
  entry: python3 scripts/validate_secrets.py
  language: system
```

**After:**

```yaml
- id: esphome-secrets-validation
  entry: .githooks/mise-python-wrapper.sh scripts/validate_secrets.py
  language: script
```

### Results

- ✅ Pre-commit hooks now use the same Python environment as manual script execution
- ✅ Hooks can access PyYAML and other Mise-managed dependencies
- ✅ Graceful fallback to system Python if Mise is unavailable
- ✅ All Python security framework hooks running successfully

## Historical Context

### Security Framework Evolution

1. **Initial Implementation**: Basic bash scripts for credential validation
2. **Mixed Approach**: Combination of bash and Python scripts
3. **Python Migration**: Unified Python framework with shared library
4. **Environment Integration**: Mise integration for consistent tool management

### Key Milestones

- **Security Hook Implementation**: Initial credential detection and validation
- **1Password Integration**: Automated credential retrieval and management
- **Python Framework**: Unified security library with comprehensive testing
- **Development Environment**: Safe development credentials and testing utilities

### Lessons Learned

- **Unified Language**: Using Python throughout improves maintainability and testing
- **Environment Consistency**: Proper tool environment management is critical for automation
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests catch issues early and improve reliability
- **Documentation Integration**: Clear documentation prevents confusion during transitions

## Current State

### Active Security Framework

The current security framework consists of:

- **Python Security Library**: [`scripts/security_lib.py`](../../scripts/security_lib.py)
- **Validation Scripts**: Comprehensive credential and configuration validation
- **Testing Framework**: Full unit test coverage with mock support
- **Integration Points**: Task runner and pre-commit hook integration

### Ongoing Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Security patterns and validation rules updated as needed
- **Testing**: Continuous testing ensures reliability and catches regressions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation maintained for all components
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with development and deployment workflows
