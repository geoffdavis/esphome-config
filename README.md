## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Install project tools
mise install

# Set up security framework
python3 scripts/setup_security.py

# Configure credentials (choose one)
echo "OP_ACCOUNT=your-1password-account" > .env  # Production
task dev-setup                                   # Development
```

### 2. Deploy Your First Device
```bash
# For ESP32/ESP8266 devices
task upload -- device_name

# For ESP01 devices (memory constrained)
task upload-two-stage -- device_name
```

### 3. Validate Security
```bash
# Run security validation
task security-validate

# Run comprehensive security scan
task security-scan
```

## 🧠 Memory Bank Integration

This project uses a **Memory Bank** system in [`.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/`](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/) that contains authoritative technical information. The documentation in [`docs/`](docs/) provides user-friendly guides that link to Memory Bank content rather than duplicating it.

**Key Memory Bank Files:**
- **[System Architecture](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/architecture.md)** - Complete technical architecture
- **[Common Tasks](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tasks.md)** - Detailed workflow procedures
- **[Technology Stack](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/tech.md)** - Tools and dependencies

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Python Security Framework**: Comprehensive credential validation and management
- **1Password Integration**: Secure credential storage and automated retrieval
- **Automated Validation**: Pre-commit hooks prevent credential exposure
- **Credential Rotation**: Automated rotation with zero-downtime deployment
- **Device Recovery**: Fallback hotspots prevent device bricking

## 🔧 Device Support

### Hardware Platforms
- **ESP32**: Full-featured devices with ample resources
- **ESP8266**: Standard IoT devices (NodeMCU, D1 Mini variants)
- **ESP01**: Memory-constrained devices with two-stage deployment

### Device Types
- **Environmental Sensors**: Temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality
- **Control Devices**: Heat pumps, smart outlets, LED controllers
- **Multi-sensors**: Combined environmental monitoring devices

## 📋 Common Commands

```bash
# List all available tasks
task -l

# Build and deploy single device
task upload -- device_name

# Deploy all devices (handles ESP01 two-stage automatically)
task upload-all-two-stage

# Security operations
task security-validate              # Essential validation
task security-scan                 # Comprehensive scan
task security-rotate-credentials   # Rotate credentials

# Development
task dev-setup                     # Development environment
task test-security                 # Run security tests
```

- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in connectivity and performance tracking

## 📖 Documentation Structure

The documentation follows a layered approach:

1. **[Quick Start](docs/getting-started/quick-start.md)** - Essential setup and first deployment
2. **[Topic Guides](docs/)** - User-friendly guides for common operations
3. **[Memory Bank](.kilocode/rules/memory-bank/)** - Complete technical documentation
4. **[Reference](docs/reference/)** - Comprehensive command and troubleshooting reference

This structure eliminates duplication while ensuring both accessibility and completeness.
